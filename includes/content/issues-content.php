				<h4>From the very beginning of our relatively short history as a nation, The United States has always had to be watchful for people and groups who have wanted to take down America and to diminish her power. Today is no different from the past. The threat to our nation has only changed its shape and name.</h4>

				<h3>Remove the United Nations</h3>
				<p>The political entity that now endangers the sovereignty and security of the United States above any other, is the United Nations. That may seem shocking for someone to say. But if it is shocking to you, it is only because you don't know what I know, and you have not seen what I've seen. Right now, the most important thing every American can do is to learn about <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org" rel="external" target="_blank">the United Nations book, Agenda 21</a>. We must take them at their word, for in these <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/Agenda21.pdf" rel="external" target="_blank">350 pages</a> they delineate with exactitude how they plan to completely destroy America as we know it.</p>

				<p>Right here, in our State of California, we have been attacked viciously by this entity. Remember the "Wildfires?" That was a U.N. orchestrated arson event. If you are now hearing this for the first time, beware. I see how people want to pretend the fires are real. There is no Climate Change Monster, which can burn houses from the inside out, sparing the surrounding vegetation. If we think we can just pretend our way out of this one, we are wrong. This problem will not go away unless we can elect people to office who will never sell out the people. I am such a person. Every single other candidate for the office of Governor of California, will attempt to keep the status quo going by continuing to implement U.N. Agenda 21 programs without the consent of their constituencies.</p>
				<p>Current Agenda 21 programs you are now living under (to name a few):</p>
				<ul>

					<li>Common Core (reverse education)</li>

					<li>Geoengineering and 5G cell tower proliferation</li>

					<li><abbr title="Genetically Modified Organism">GMO</abbr> depopulation food</li>

					<li><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB277" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Mandatory vaccinations">Mandatory vaccinations</a></li>

					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Fluoride">Fluoride</a> in the water</li>

					<li>Attack from fire</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If any country did these things to us, Americans would be inclined to attack them back and to destroy them. This is exactly what I urge Californians, and Americans, to do. It does no good to run from an enemy, you must turn and attack them back. In the case of an institution such as The United Nations, this means dismantling it entirely. We are at the juncture in history when that is a necessary event, and we must grow up and be brave and get the job done. It is California who must turn the tide and halt the takeover of global socialism, which is the object of the U.N.'s fervent quest.</p>

				<p>To be honest, all of these machinations spring from one fountain. They are all as a result of Americans allowing their constitutional form of government to be sidestepped. Treason is the new normal. And as always, tyranny is right behind it.</p>

				<p>Of course, we're most grateful for your early support of Peter's Gubernatorial Campaign and look forward to working together in our continued effort towards creating a thriving California environment for all.</p>

				<p>Californians have noticed that the government has ceased listening to them. This is because our government was taken over by another entity, the Unite Nations. All our lingering issues stem from that:</p>

				<a id="education" class="named-anchor"></a>
				<h3>Education</h3>
				<p>I will ban <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Common Core Education">Common Core Education</a> immediately. I call this program "reverse education." By this I mean it is a system of mental destruction for the youth of America. If you are a parent, you probably have noticed that your child is now having trouble in areas they did not have trouble before. This system of education is an attack against us, as people, by attacking the weakest amongst us, our children. The whole ridiculous Common Core system is straight out of <a href="http://www.un-documents.net/a21-36.htm" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Chapter 36 of the U.N. Agenda 21">Chapter 36 of the U.N. Agenda 21 book</a>. The UN effectively ordered America to take on this universal educational system, and we will have to move very quickly to restore our traditional form of education to avoid a catastrophe.</p>
				<hr>
				<a id="vaccinations" class="named-anchor"></a>
				<h3>Vaccinations</h3>
				<p>On a similar note, we must remove the law of mandatory vaccinations of our children. These so-called medicines have been proven time and again to be detrimental. The U.S. vaccinates children much more than any other nation, and America's children are among the sickest in the world. How can we pretend not to know this? It's because we are generally deluded by Western medicine. I say that the State must actively promote the general health and welfare of every citizen. The State cannot sit on the sidelines and watch its own children be decimated because of the needs of a global power.</p>

				<p>Under my governorship, California will watch over our children and protect them. We will move to a system based on informed consent. The same group who sticks our kids wants us all to be universally vaccinated. We must stop this now before they come after us all. Again, it's all written in the U.N. Agenda 21 plan.</p>

				<a id="homelessness" class="named-anchor"></a>
				<h3>Homelessness and Poverty</h3>
				<p>This is a problem that is seemingly insurmountable, but it's really not. I recall a time when there was no homelessness. Somebody decided that it would exist and so it does. The homeless problem exists for two reasons and two reasons only.</p>

				<p>Firstly, The conservatives think that it would be socialism for the State to facilitate the building of low income housing for homeless people (but it won’t be).</p>

				<p>Secondly the liberals do not want to enforce the existent vagrancy laws (but this will have to be done). Both sides will have to change for the problem to be solved. Stated very simply: The only way to solve the homeless problem is to house the homeless and to enforce the vagrancy laws. This is the only way it will ever be solved and anything else we pretend to do will be nonsense.</p>

				<p>This must be done in conjunction with a program that seeks to decipher the differences in the homeless population and their specific problems. We mustn't think only of giving people housing, but making sure that each citizen has the opportunity to work and to take care of their own responsibilities. Individuals must be seen and understood and re-educated in ways that will help them to get on their feet again.</p>

				<p>Some may take exception to the fact that I have not stated that a higher minimum wage will cure homelessness. That is because it will not. The homeless problem goes back to our faulty educational system. The problem with constantly increasing the minimum wage is that many people who are badly or less educated will fall below the qualifications required for that wage. This makes them unemployable at a certain standard set by the State and guarantees that they will be unemployed. The State must see to the existence of low income housing, and then introduce a flexible wage to bring homeless people back into the system so that they may be trained and reeducated to attain higher goals. </p>

				<p>My administration will completely end homelessness. We will accomplish it in a graceful, compassionate and disciplined way. We as Americans must solve the problem of homelessness ourselves, or the United Nations will come and solve it for us, making us all equally controlled by a technocratic socialist system.</p>

				<h3>Weather Modification</h3>
				<p>Have you ever heard of <a href="http://www.weathermodification.com/projects.php" rel="external" target="_blank">weather modification</a>? Most people don't even know that it's possible, let alone that it has been done to our skies for the last many decades. The fact that so few people recognize the existence of these chemical trails coming from airplanes covering our skies constantly amazes me.</p>

				<p>How is it possible for human beings to exist who say that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoengineering" rel="external" target="_blank">Geoengineering</a> is a conspiracy theory when the skies are full of it every day? <strong>All you have to do is look at the sky</strong> and know a little bit about what you're looking for. Those who do not want to look, have chosen to remain perpetual children. It is only a society of perpetual children who would kill their young through the multitudinous poisons we throw at them. We must become aware that aircraft spraying of aerosols in conjunction with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave">microwaves</a>, the kind that can be generated through <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-cellphone-5g-health-20160808-snap-story.html" rel="external" target="_blank">5G networks</a>, are by far the greatest danger to our health.</p> 
				<hr>
				<a id="depopulation" class="named-anchor"></a>
				<h3>U.N. Depopulation Plan</h3>
				<p>It's as simple as this: The U.N. thinks there are too many of us and they have decided to reduce our numbers drastically. There is no sector of society that is not touched by this depopulation system. It has been going on your entire life. We now have a rare opportunity in California to end these depopulation programs against us. It is through the election of <a href="about.php">Peter Crawford-Valentino</a> to the office of Governor of the State of California. Our over-arching problem is that too many people in government only care about the well-being of the corporations and not about the well-being of their constituency—the people. My administration will bullishly turn this around. All forms of U.N. and Federal depopulation will be banned by California under my tutelage.</p>
				<hr>
				<a id="ban_gmo" class="named-anchor"></a>
				<h3>Banning Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO)</h3>
				<p>As I've said before, it is not good enough just to run from your enemy, but you must turn and defeat the one who aggresses against you. This is the only way to avoid a life of having to look over your shoulder wondering when the next attack will arrive. GMO food is U.N. food. It is part of the depopulation program against American citizens. I am not in favor of labeling&mdash;I am in favor of absolutely banning the poison from our shelves.</p>
				<p>All these GMO foods require levels of <a href="https://monsanto.com/company/media/statements/glyphosate-herbicide/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Monsanto's Roundup - Glyphosate">Monsanto's Roundup</a> which are far in excess of what should be allowed for human intake. Our government has been taken over by the very people who promote Monsanto. This action by the Fed is highly unconstitutional and must be immediately overturned.</p>
				<hr>
				<a id="seniors" class="named-anchor"></a>
				<h3>Watching Out for Our Senior Citizens</h3>
				<p>Under current U.N. policies, much is being done to kill our elderly population. The rate of <a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_what_is_alzheimers.asp" rel="external" target="_blank">Alzheimer's</a> has increased markedly in the last few years. This is due primarily to spurious vaccinations and to chemical trails administered by aircraft.</p>

				<p>These two sources are both high in toxic aluminum, which is one of the primary causes of Alzheimer's. We must watch over our elderly just as we watch over our children, for they are in a time of weakened health. We must see that they are protected from the onslaught of U.N. depopulation measures.</p>

				<p>We need our grandparents alive to help teach our children!</p>
				<hr>
				<a id="economic_development" class="named-anchor"></a>
				<h3>Economic Development</h3>
				<p>Government interventionism is the greatest drag upon economic development. The more <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialism" rel="external" target="_blank">socialism</a>, the less likely Government is able to balance the budget. By curing homelessness, we will stimulate neighborhoods and local economies. By protecting the health of our people, we will get them working again. We will solve the current care crisis and the overpopulation of our hospitals by constantly advocating for the removal of all depopulation foods, vaccines, and aircraft aerosols etc. We will create a safe and prosperous State, that we may be a beacon for all citizens of the United States of America.</p>
