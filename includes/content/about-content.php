				<p>Peter Crawford-Valentino is a teacher, writer, performer, filmmaker and businessman. He has produced many films and shorts on the subject of Truth in Government, including the 2014 docudrama, “PAPAMUNDI and the 9/11 Mechanism.” His work on exposing the 9/11 Coup d'état is the deepest and most coherent of anything hat has been released.</p> 

				<p>A California native, Peter has a vision for a better California. The answer to the problems which beset us is to get back to the traditions and practices we threw away in our quest for modernity. By being progressive for its own sake, we have progressed to a place of great danger for us and our civilization. Mr. Valentino has a plan to re-balance California and he has the energy to pull it off. </p>

				<p>A vote for Peter Crawford-Valentino is a vote against the totalitarian onslaught of the UN and their Agenda 21. The time is now. This is the moment in history where America wakes up and shrugs off the shackles of UN hegemony and reboots its Constitutional form of government. We must snatch the American dream from the jaws of forced globalism.</p>
